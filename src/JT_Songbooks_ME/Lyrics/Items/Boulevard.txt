I don't know why [Am] , you said goodbye [Dm]
Just let me know [F] you didn't go [E] forever my love [Am]
Please tell me why[Am] , You make me cry [Dm]
I beg you please [F] all my money [E] if that what you want me too [Am]

Chorus:
Never [Am] knew that it would go so far [Dm]
Why [G7] you love me you let boulevard [C]
Come [Am] again you would release [Dm] my pain
And we could [F] be lover [E7] again [Am]

Just one more chance [Am] , Another dance [Dm]
And let me feel [F] it isnÂ’t real [E] that I've been loosing you [Am]
This sound will arrive [Am] , Within your eyes [Dm]
Come back to me [F] and we will be [E] happy together [Am]
Chorus

Maybe today [Am] , I'll make you stay [Dm]
A little while [F] just for a smile [E] and love together [Am]
For I will show [Am] , A place I know [Dm]
In Tokyo [F] where we could be [E] happy together [Am]
