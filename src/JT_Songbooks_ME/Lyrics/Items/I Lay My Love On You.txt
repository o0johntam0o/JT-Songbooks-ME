[Am] Just a smile and the [Dm] rain is gone
[G] Can hardly [C] believe it [Em] Yeah
[Am] There's an angel standing [Dm] next to me
[F] Reaching [G] for my [C] heart [G]

[Am] Just a smile and there's [Dm] no way back
[G] Can hardly [C] believe it [Em] Yeah
But [Am] there's an angel she's [Dm] calling me
[F] Reaching [G] for my [C] heart [G]

I know, [Am] that I'll be ok now
[C] This [F] time it's [G] real

I lay my love on [D] you
It's all I want to [A] do
Every time I [Bm] breathe I feel brand [A] new
You open up my [D] heart
Show me all your [A] love, and walk
Right [Em] through
As I [G] lay my [A] love on [D] you

[Am] I was lost in a [Dm] lonely place
[G] Could hardly [C] believe it [Em] Yeah
[Am] Holding on to [Dm] yesterdays
[G] Far, [C] far too [G] long

Now I [Am] believe its ok cause
[C] This [F] time it's [G] real

I lay my love on [D] you
It's all I want to [A] do
Every time I [Bm] breathe I feel brand [A] new
You open up my [D] heart
Show me all your [A] love, and walk
Right [Em] through
As I [G] lay my [A] love on [D] you

[D] | [G] | [A] | [D] [G]
I never knew that love could fell so good

Like a [Bm] once in a lifetime
[D] You [G] change my [A] world
