[D7] When I was [G] youngI'd listen to the [Bm] radioWaitin' [Em] for my favorite [Em] songsWhen they [C] played I'd sing [Bm] alongIt made me [Am] smile. [D7]Those were [G] such happy timesAnd not so [Bm] long agoHow I [Em] wondered where they'd [C] gone[F#m] But [B7] they're [Em] back againJust like a [C] long lost friendAll the [Am] songs I [C] loved so [D7sus] well.[C] Eve [D7] ry [G] sha-la-la-laEvery [Em] wo-o-wo-oStill [G] shines [Em]Every [G] shing-a-ling-a-lingThat they're [Em] startin' to sing'sSo [Am] fine. [D7]When they [Em] get to the partWhere he's [C] breakin' her heartIt can [G] really make me [C] cryJust like [G] beforeIt's [C] yesterday once [G] more. [Am]Shoo be [G] do lang [Am] lang [D7]Lookin' [G] back on how it wasIn [Bm] years gone byAnd the [Em] good times that [Em] I hadMakes [C] today seem rather [Bm] sadSo much has [Am] changed. [D7]It was [G] songs of love thatI would [Bm] sing to thenAnd I'd [Em] memorize each [C] word[F#m] Those [B7] old melo [Em] diesStill sound [C] so good to meAs they [Am] melt the [C] years [D7] away.[C] Eve [D7] ry [G] sha-la-la-laEvery [Em] wo-o-wo-oStill [G] shines [Em]Every [G] shing-a-ling-a-lingThat they're [Em] startin' to sing'sSo [Am] fine. [D7]All my [Em] best memoriesCome back [C] clearly to meSome can [G] even make me [C] cry.Just like [G] beforeIt's [C] yesterday once [G] more. [Am][G] Shoo be do lang [Am] lang [D7]
