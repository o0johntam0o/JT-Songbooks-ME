I [Bm] stand [F#m] alone in the [G] dark-[D]-nessThe [Em] winter of [A] my life [Bm] came so [F#] fast[Bm] Memories [F#m] go back to [G] child-[D]-hood[Em] To days I [A] still re-[Bm]-call[Bm] Oh how [F#m] happy I [G] was [D] then[Em] There was no [A] sorrow [Bm] there was no [F#] pain[Bm] Walking [F#m] through the [G] green [D] fields[Em] Sunshine [A] in my [Bm] eyesIm still [G] there every [A] whereIm the [D] dust [A] in the [Bm] windIm the [G] star in the [A] northern [Bm] skyI never [G] stayed any [A] whereIm the [D] wind [A] in the [Bm] treesWould you [G] wait for [A] me for-[Bm]-ever?
