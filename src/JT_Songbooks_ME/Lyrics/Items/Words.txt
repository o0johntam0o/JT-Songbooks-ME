[D] Smile an everlasting [D] smile,
A smile could bring you [E] near to me
Don't [A] ever let me find you [A] gone
'Cause [A] that would bring a [G] tear to [D] me
This [F] world has lost it's [F] glory,
Let's [F] start a brand new story [C] now, my [C] love
Right [D] now there'll be no other time
And I can show you [E] how, my [A] love [A7]
/verse/ [D] Talk in everlasting [D] words
And dedicate them [E] all to me
And [A] I will give you all my [A] life
I'm [A] here if you should [G] call to [D] me
You [F] think that I don't even [F] mean
A single word I [A] say
It's only [D] words, and words are all I [A] have
To take your heart [D] away
La la laÂ… /same like verse/
You [F] think that I don't even [F] mean
A single word I [A] say
It's only [D] words, and words are all I [A] have
To take your heart [D] away.
