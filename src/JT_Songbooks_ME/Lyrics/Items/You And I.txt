[C] [E] [Am] [Dm] [G] [G]
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] because of you [G] babe
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] when you look at me [G] like this
[C] There's something in your [Am] eyes that is [Dm] saying [G] tonight
I'm not a [C] child anymore, life has [Am] opened the door
To a [Dm] new exciting [G] life
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] when I'm close to you [G] babe
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] don't look at me [G] like this
[C] There's something in your [Am] eyes, is this [Dm] love at [G] first sight
Like a [C] flower that grows, life just [Am] wants you to know
All [Dm] the secrets of [G] life
It's all written [Dm] down in your [Em] lifelines
It's written [Dm] down inside your [G] heart
Chorus:
[C] You and [Am] I just [Dm] have a [G] dream
[C] To find our [Am] love a place, where [Dm] we can hide [G] away
[C] You and [Am] I were [Dm] just [G] made
[C] To love each [Am] other now, for [Dm] ever and a [G] day
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] because of you [G] babe
[C] I lose [Am] control [Dm] don't look at me [G] like this
[C] There's something in your [Am] eyes that is [Dm] saying [G] tonight
I'm so [C] curious for more just [Am] like never before
In [Dm] my innocent [G] life
It's all written [Dm] down in your [Em] lifelines
It's written [Dm] down inside your [G] heart
/Chorus/
[Am] Time stands [G] still [F] when the days of innocence
Are [G] falling for the night
I [Am] love you girl I always [G] will
[F] I swear I'm there for you
Till [G] the day I die
/Chorus/
