[G]If the hero, never [Dm]comes to you
[G]If you need someone, youre [C]feeling blue
If you wait for love, and [F]youre [Dm]alone
[G]If you call your friends, no[C]bodys home
You can run away, but [F]you cant hide
[G]Through a storm and through a [C]lonely night
[Am]Then Ill show you theres a [Dm]destiny
The best things in [F]life, they are [G]free

But if you wanna [F]cry: cry on my [G]shoulder
If you need some[Em]one, who cares for [Am]you
If youre feeling [F]sad, your heart gets [G]colder
[Dm]Yes I show you what real love can [G]do

If your sky is grey oh [Dm]let me know
[G]Theres a place in heaven, [C]where well go
If heaven is, a [F]million years a[Dm]way
[G]Oh just call me and Ill [C]make your day
When the nights are getting [F]cold and blue
[G]When the days are getting [C]hard for you
[Am]I will always stay [Dm]by your side
I promise [F]you, Ill never [G]hide
