[Dm]Everyday my papa workedTo [Gm] help to make ends meetTo [A7] see that we would eat[To] [Dm] keep those shoes upon my feetEvery night my papa would takeAnd [Gm] tuck me in my bedKiss [A7] me on my headAfter [Dm] all my prayers were saidGrowing up with him was easytime just flew on byThe years began to flyHe aged and so did I[Bb] I could [C]tellThat [A7] mama wasn't [Dm] wellPapa [Bb] knew and [C] deep down so did [F] sheSo did [A7] she[Bb] When she [C] diedMy [A7] papa broke down and [Dm] cried[Bb] All he said was, [Gm] "God, Why not take [A7] me!"/giong doan 1/Every night he sat there sleeping in his rocking chairHe never went upstairsAll because she wasn't thereThen one day my Papa said,"Son, I'm proud /of/ the way you've grownmake it on your ownI'll be O.K. alone."Every time I kiss my childrenPapa's words ring true"Your children live through you.They'll grow and leave you, too"I remember every word my papa used to sayI live that every dayHe taught me well that wayEvery night my papa would takeAnd tuck me in my bedKiss me on my headAfter all my prayers were saidEvery night my papa would take.And tuck me in my bedTuck me in my bedAfter all my prayers were said.
