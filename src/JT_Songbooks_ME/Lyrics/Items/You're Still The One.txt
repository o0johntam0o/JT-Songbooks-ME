[E] Looks like we made it
[A] Look how far we've [B] come my baby
[E] We mighta took the long way
[A] We knew we'd get [B] there someday
[E] They said, " [A] I bet they'll [B] never make it"
But just [E] look at us [A] holding [B] on
We're still [E] together still [A] going [B] strong [A] 
Chorus:
[A] /You're still the [E] one/
[E] You're still the one I [A] run to
[F#m] The one that I [B] belong to
[E] You're still the one I [A] want for [B] life [A]
[A] /You're still the [E] one/
[E] You're still the one that [A] I love
[F#m] The only one I [B] dream of
[E] You're still the one I [A] kiss good [B] night
[E] Ain't nothin' better
[A] We beat the [B] odds together
[E] I'm glad we didn't listen
[A] Look at what we [B] would be missin'
[E] They said, " [A] I bet they'll [B] never make it"
But just [E] look at us [A] holding [B] on
We're still [E] together still [A] going [B] strong [A]
/Chorus/ x 2
Im so [E] glad we make it 
Look [A] how far, weve [B] come my baby [E]
