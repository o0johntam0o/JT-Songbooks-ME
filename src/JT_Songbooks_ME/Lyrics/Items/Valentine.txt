[C]           [Am]                [F]
If there were no words no where to speak
       [G]
I would still here you
[C]           [Am]                [F]

       [G]
I'd still feel for you

Even if romance ran out of rhyme

And shown me how to love unselfishly

You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
