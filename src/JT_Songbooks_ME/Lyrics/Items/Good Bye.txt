Sol-Sol-Sol..
[C]I can see the pain living in your [Em]eyes
And I know how hard you [Am]try
You deserve to [F]have so much [G]more
[C]I can feel your heart and I sympa[Em]thize
And I'll never criti[Am]cize all you've ever [F]meant to my life[G]

CHORUS
[C]I don't want to let you [Am]down
[F]I don't want to lead you [G]on
[Em]I don't want to hold you [Am]back
From [F]where you might be[G]long

[C]You would never ask me [Am]why
My heart is so dis[F]guised
I just can't live a [G]lie anymore [G7]

[C]I would rather hurt my[Am]self
Than to ever make you [F]cry
There's nothing left to [G]say but good[C]bye

You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me

I don't want to let you down
I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back
From where you might belong

You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say, but goodbye

You would never ask me why
My heart is so disguised
I just can't live a lie anymore
I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to try
Though it's gonna hurt us both
There's no other way than to say goodbye.
