[G] Saying I [Cadd9] love you is
[Am7] not the words I [C] want to [D] hear from [G] you
[G] It's not that I [Cadd9] want you
[Am7] not to say but [C] if you [D] only [Em] knew
[Bm7] Ho-ow [Am7] ea-sy
[D] It would be to [G] show me [D]/[F#] how you [Em] feel
[Bm7] More than [Am7] words is [D7] all you have to [G7] do
[G7] To make it [C] real
[C] Then you [Cm] wouldn't have to [G] say
That you [Em7] love me 'cos
[Am7] I'd [D7] already [G] know

[G] What would you do [D]/[F#] if my [Em] heart was [Bm] torn in [C] two
[C] More than words to [G]/[B] show you [Am7] feel that your [D7] love for me is [G] real
[G] What would you say [D]/[F#] if I [Em7] took those [Bm7] words [C] away?
[C] Then you couldn't make [G]/[B] things [Am7] new
Just by [D7] saying I love [G] you

Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All that you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me
Cos I'd All Ready Know

[G] What would you do [D]/[F#] if my [Em] heart was [Bm] torn in [C] two
[C] More than words to [G]/[B] show you [Am7] feel that your [D7] love for me is [G] real
[G] What would you say [D]/[F#] if I [Em7] took those [Bm7] words [C] away?
[C] Then you couldn't make [G]/[B] things [Am7] new
Just by [D7] saying I love [G] you
