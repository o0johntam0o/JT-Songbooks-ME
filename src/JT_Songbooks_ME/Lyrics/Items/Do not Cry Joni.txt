[D] Jimmy, please say you ll [A] wait for me
[A7] I ll grow up some [D] day you ll see
[D7] Saving all my kisses [G] just for you
[A] Signed with love for [A7] ever [D] true.

[D] Joni was the girl who [A] lived next door
I ve known her, I guess, ten [D] years or more
[D7] Joni wrote me a [G] note one day
[A] And this is what she [A7] had to [D] say

[D] Slowly I read her [A] note once more
Then [A7] I went over to the [D] house next door
Her [D7] teardrops fell like [G] rain that day
When [A] I told Joni what I [A7] had to [D] say.

[D] Joni, Joni, [A] please don t cry
[A7] You ll forget me [D] by and by
You re [D7] just fifteen, I m [G] twenty-two
And [A] Joni, I just can t [A7] wait for [D] you.

[D] Soon I left our [A] little hometown
[A7] Got me a job and tried to [D] settle down
But the [D7] words kept haunting my [G] memory
[A] The words that Joni [A7] said to [D] me

[D] I packed my clothes and I [A] caught a plane
I [A7] had to see Joni, I [D] had to explain
How my [D7] heart was filled with her [G] memory
[A] And ask my Joni if she d [A7] marry [D] me

[D] I ran all the way to the [A] house next door
But [A7] things weren t like they [D] were before.
My [D7] teardrops fell like [G] rain that day
When [A] I heard what Joni [A7] had to [D] say

[D] Jimmy, Jimmy, [A] please don t cry
[A7] You ll forget me [D] by and by
It s [D7] been five years since [G] you ve been gone
[A] Jimmy, I married your [A7] best friend [D] John.
